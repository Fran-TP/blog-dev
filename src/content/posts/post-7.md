Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing actual code.

## The TDD Cycle

1. **Write a test**: Define what the function should do.
2. **Run the test**: It should fail initially.
3. **Write the minimal code**: Just enough to pass the test.
4. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests passing.

## Benefits of TDD

- Reduces bugs and improves code quality.
- Provides documentation through test cases.
- Encourages modular design.

Adopting TDD can lead to more reliable and maintainable software.

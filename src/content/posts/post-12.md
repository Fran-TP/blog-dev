Fast and responsive web applications are crucial for user experience. Optimizing frontend performance can significantly improve loading times and interactivity.

## Key Optimization Strategies

1. **Minimize HTTP Requests**: Reduce the number of assets loaded on a page.
2. **Lazy Loading**: Load images and resources only when needed.
3. **Optimize JavaScript and CSS**: Minify and bundle files for faster delivery.
4. **Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Distribute content closer to users.

## Measuring Performance

- Use tools like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Chrome DevTools.
- Monitor Core Web Vitals (Largest Contentful Paint, Cumulative Layout Shift, First Input Delay).

Applying these techniques ensures a smooth and fast user experience.

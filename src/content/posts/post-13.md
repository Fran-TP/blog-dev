Security is a critical aspect of software development. Writing secure code helps prevent vulnerabilities and protects applications from cyber threats.

## Essential Secure Coding Practices

1. **Input Validation**: Always sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
2. **Use Strong Authentication**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
3. **Secure Data Storage**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
4. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update third-party libraries to patch security flaws.

## Common Security Threats

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Insecure API Endpoints

By following secure coding best practices, developers can build resilient and trustworthy applications.

RESTful APIs power modern web applications. In this post, we will explore the principles of REST and how to design effective APIs.

## Key Concepts

1. **Statelessness**: Each request is independent and does not rely on previous requests.
2. **HTTP Methods**:

   - `GET` for retrieving data.
   - `POST` for creating resources.
   - `PUT` for updating resources.
   - `DELETE` for removing resources.

3. **JSON as Data Format**: REST APIs typically use JSON for data exchange.

Understanding RESTful principles will help you build scalable and efficient APIs.

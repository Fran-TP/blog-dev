Microservices architecture is a software development approach that structures applications as a collection of small, independent services.

## Key Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand.
2. **Flexibility**: Different services can be written in different programming languages.
3. **Resilience**: Failures in one service do not affect the entire system.

## Challenges

- Managing multiple services requires proper orchestration.
- Requires robust API communication between services.
- Deployment and monitoring can be complex.

Adopting microservices can lead to more scalable and maintainable software solutions.

DevOps is a culture and practice that brings development and operations teams together to improve efficiency and collaboration.

## Key DevOps Practices

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Developers merge code frequently, reducing integration issues.
2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automated deployment pipelines ensure faster releases.
3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure using code improves consistency.

## Benefits of DevOps

- Faster delivery of software updates.
- Improved collaboration between teams.
- Increased reliability through automation.

Adopting DevOps practices can help teams build scalable, high-quality software efficiently.
